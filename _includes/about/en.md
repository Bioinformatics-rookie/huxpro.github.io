> Day before yesterday I saw a rabbit, and yesterday a deer, and today, you.

Hello,I'm Zhou Xiaozhao. I'm studying in Kunming Institute of Botany. I'm a graduate student who is going to be bald. I'm a novice. I mainly share some of my learning process to prevent forgetting. I'm also welcome to learn and exchange with you.

I like watching animes and making pasta in my spare time(As a northerner, I feel that the Steamed buns in Kunming is too soft, so I'd better make it myself),Current [blog]（ www.zhouxiaozhao.cn ）And [short book]（ https://www.jianshu.com/u/e774b57cc676 ）It's my main battlefield. You can find me in these two places.

GitHub gives us a free domain name, and we can use Jekyll + GitHub to build our own blog based on[ huangxuan.me ] huangxuan.me ）Create it after modification. I feel that the topic is very clear. You can go to [GitHub] if you like（ https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io ）The author is supported by fork and star.
